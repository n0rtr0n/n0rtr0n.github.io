TL;DR: This week, my bike was stolen and recovered and I have some security-related takeaways.

# The Bike
For the last 8 or so years, living in a place that was mostly flat, my 3-speed bicycle got me around just fine. Where I moved, riding a 3-speed was basically riding on hard mode. After a few months of living here, I bought a shiny new 18-speed bicycle for around $1300. I decked it out with some fenders to protect my backside from the sometimes slushy ground. Because I work in security and think about these things a lot, I also invested in a set of wheel locks for the back and a monster of a U-lock.

I bike just about everywhere, and although I clocked about 300 miles on it, I only had it for a month before it was lamentably yoinked. I spent time perfecting the technique for travel. I came up with a system where I could safely and nimbly ride and park it without needing a backpack; carrying the U-lock on my handlebars and keeping compact lights in my pocket when away from where it was locked up. The U-lock was threaded through the quick-release front wheel and the frame, and the back was protected from the wheel lock, which takes a particular type of tooling and persistence to defeat. On the night of the theft, I had also parked it in an area that was visible to the passerby and had a fair amount of foot traffic. To me, this seemed like enough to deter thieves. Lo and behold, it was not. 

# The Scene

I was joking with someone earlier that day about how the worst thing that had happened to me here was getting a single pedal stolen off my previous bike - something innocuous compared to an entire bicycle. Less than an hour passed between last seeing the bike and coming back to find my monster of a U-lock cut into two pieces. Hilariously, my helmet was also left at the scene; safety first, right?! Others have told me, based on these pictures, that the attack was likely performed with an angle grinder.

When I had bought the bike, I immediately registered it on [Bike Index](https://bikeindex.org/). When I got home that night, I marked it as stolen and filed a police report. I also reached out to several people who may have some advice, and they told me that watching Craigslist and OfferUp might help, but to start preparing to accept my loss. Though I knew the chances were slim, I went back to the scene the next day for recon.

This will shock exactly ***zero*** people who are in the security industry, but almost *none* of the cameras in and around the businesses pointing at bike rack seemed to be active and/or recording. I spent several hours walking around the block. I knocked on every door and called every number on every sign within an entire block's radius, to absolutely no avail. There was a ***big*** sign posted right across the street noting that the premises was being surveilled by a particular security company. I called the number on it, and the phone just continuously rang for several minutes before I hung up. In other words, these cameras were almost *exclusively* installed for show. There was one camera inside a building in front of the scene, and they were very kind and sent me a sample of the video they caught. The footage was blurry, so it was not able to provide any useful details. Womp womp.

# Good News Is Not Just For People Who Love Bad News
I spent a full 36 hours in shock and disbelief. This morning, I got a phone call from the local police department claiming that they had found the bike in a local encampment sans a front wheel. They had just seen my report about my shiny new bicycle and happened to catch the glare of one that matched my description while on patrol. When they recovered it, they discovered a cache of other stolen bicycles. I'm thankful that even though I am down a wheel, that others were able to get some of their property back in the process. 

# Closing Thoughts
There are several morals to the story:
* There is a weakness in every system. Even U-locks are defeated by the right tools. Sometimes you can do everything that you're supposed to do and still get compromised.  Between the U-lock, the back wheel lock, and leaving it in a relatively well-lit area with moderate foot traffic, I felt the controls satisfied my particular threat model. I guess I could have carried my bike with me inside? Then again, who has time for this type of hyper-vigilance? We must accept that there is only so much that we can do and that even things we think are secure are only effective up to a certain point. We should prepare for the worst, even when we plan for the best.
* Installing cameras is apparently not an effective method for increasing the security of a system. In fact, if cameras are connected to the internet, they may even *decrease* the level of security in a system. If you decide that you do not want to live without cameras and you need to protect some property, then for the love all things holy, please turn them on and make sure they are actually recording. If criminals think that cameras do not work, then literally half of their utility is eliminated by default, and this sends the signal that the presence of cameras should not deter criminal activity.
* The more expensive something is, the more of a target is. The fact that it "looked" expensive was part of why it got returned to me so quickly, but it likely would not have been stolen in the first place if it didn't have as much of a perceived value. I will probably never buy an even moderately expensive bike again. Hell, I may even take some sandpaper to the paint on my next bike to intentionally decrease its perceived value. If you're also "function over form", "utility over aesthetic" people, I see you right now.
* Register your bike with [Bike Index](https://bikeindex.org) proactively, and donate to them if you want to help. They do some fantastic work in the cycling community. Even if it doesn't happen, their existence will significantly increase my chances of getting it back. They also have some great instructions for what to do if your bike gets stolen: https://bikeindex.org/stolen
