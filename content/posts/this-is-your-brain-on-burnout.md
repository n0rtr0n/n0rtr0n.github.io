A few weeks ago, I made a really tough decision; I suddenly took leave of absence from work. It may be more accurate to say that my body made this decision for me. I burned out [like you would fall asleep; slowly and then all at once](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1016842-i-fell-in-love-like-you-would-fall-asleep-slowly). This was not the first time I have burned out, yet it has been egregiously difficult. 

# What happened?

The first time I burned out completely, I landed in the hospital. I thought I was having a heart attack and ended up in the emergency room. They pumped me full of Ativan and sent me home with an anti-anxiety prescription and absolutely zero real treatment. Things have changed between now and then, yet many of the same symptoms have been recently relived. 

I really like my job; I lead the cloud security program of a unicorn startup and have an incredible team within an organizational unit that I adore. I don't work in a toxic environment. Things go well most of the time, and I have a ton of support from my teammates and my superiors. Outside of work, I am a part of several great communities and networks, and overall I have a lot to be thankful for. Opportunity, privilege, and sheer luck that have met me on the other end of risks that I have taken have fared me well, and I have few legitimate complaints.

Without going into too much detail, a lot of things happened at roughly the same time, including a big move, a new team, a breakup, a new blog (oh hey!), and a major transition with my band of almost 10 years. All of this was happening while I had been traveling almost weekly. We are also staring over the precipice of a recession, witnessing a war that seemingly has no ending that does not involve some form of global destruction, and we are *still* fighting a literal plague while potentially preparing to have to battle the next. I grossly overestimated my ability to cope with and process everything all at once.

A month or so ago, I had a full blown 5-alarm panic attack, and though I didn't end up in the ER again, took a few full days to come down enough to be functional. I didn't sleep well for that entire week, but some time passed. I woke up one morning and immediately felt vertigo and nausea upon opening my laptop. I made it through lunch, and then opened my laptop again. My heart was palpitating, I started sweating, and I had brain fog. For an entire week, every time I sat down at my workstation, my body physically revolted in some way. I knew that I had crossed the threshold from exhaustion into burnout. Taking time off was no longer a matter of choice.

# What Is Burnout? 

When you are at your best, you can feel impervious to the effects of a work-life rhythm. Your happy self can sustain a fair amount of interruptions and doing things that carry a certain amount of anguish or do not perfectly align with your goals. On the verge of burnout, it feels like death by a thousand pings. Every interruption is a coup targeted against your productivity. Every task is a giant boulder, and now you are Sisyphus, eternally pushing your burden up the hill just to have it fall down and start the process over and over again in futility. You feel sick, and your body fights against you.

((( insert Sisyphus )))

I envision burnout in terms of a pool system. The pool represents your mental health; being able to swim in the pool represents the desired state of well-being. Think of this pool being drained due to evaporation and breaches in its hull, from a combination of natural weathering and circumstantial mishaps. Burning out is much like taking damage to your hull and losing water. It Is possible at first to maintain the level that's comfortable for swimming by replenishing the lost fluids. However, when the evacuation of water accelerates because of environmental and situational factors, it can become impractical and even impossible to refill the liquid stock at the rate that it's flowing out of this system. At some point, you must fix it in order for it to hold water again, and sometimes this requires completely draining the pool. *This* is burnout. 

## What Causes Burnout?

The long story short is, burnout is the result of needs not being met. It doesn't matter if *some* needs are being met; if other needs are collectively or aggressively being unmet, then burnout is hurtling towards us. In three steps, burnout is caused by:

* **A lack of fulfilment**. Anyone who has spent a long time doing what they do presumably knows *why* they do what they do. Humans are largely purpose-driven. If we start to do things that are incongruent with our values and mission, this leads to a lack of both satisfaction and fulfillment. 
* **A lack of downtime**. Everyone needs time off. Everyone deserves repose. Everyone needs time to do things that are not work, even if they love what they do. This does not just mean sleep; this is a deep kind of restorative rest that involves being able to step away long enough to process, recharge, and recuperate from the mental tax imposed by operating in a world that has evolved much faster than humans have evolved to handle It. 
* **Feeling disconnection**. When people do not feel connected to their environment or the other people around them, they can feel isolation, which can be damaging to their mental health. There are times where it may be difficult to articulate why a situation just does not *feel* right. A sense of belonging is important to our overall well-being, and aloofness is a symptom of our need for symbiotic connection being unmet.


## Getting Back 2 Good

These are some of the most effective strategies that I have found in getting ahead of burnout:

* **Taking proactive steps**. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Anything you can do to combat burnout will be easier and more effective in the earlier stages of burnout than the later ones. Recognize the symptoms of burnout up front and do something about it before it ends up in a hospital visit.
* **Focusing on physical health**. Your physical and mental well-being are more important than almost anything that is needed from you. Physical health and mental health are linked; and one cannot be in good shape without the other. Though I'm sure that no two people agree on *how* these should be done, almost no one will argue that diet and exercise are two critical pillars of a healthy lifestyle.
* **Resting**. Sleep. Take time off. Walk away for a few days, or a week, or a year. Nothing, and I mean nothing, is eternally sustainable. It is not healthy to hyperfocus on a single task for months on end. You must take breaks. You must step away sometimes. You must rest and recharge. This does not mean taking time off from one massive project to intensely center on another; it means actually resting.
* **Doing fulfilling things**. I don't just mean doing things that are *enjoyable*, but doing things that bring lasting gratification. These are the things that align with your vision, mission, values, and goals. These are different for just about everyone on this planet. If you don't know what these things are for you, then spend some time really figuring that part out; you can't predictably meet your fulfillment needs if you don't know what actually fulfills you. 
* **Committing to less**. Even if you look at productivity in a capitalistic way, committing to less makes sense for everyone. Under-promising while over-delivering is much better than its inverse and does not hold folks to unrealistic standards. The complexity of the world we live in has made it increasingly more difficult to sustain productivity. Committing to less sometimes involves having tough conversations and saying "no" to attractive opportunities.
* **Changing your environment**. Sometimes, you may find yourself in an situation that is not harmonious with your being for overt or subtle reasons. If you know what is causing this and can fix it, great; try that! Sometimes, the best thing you can do is change your surroundings and see if it helps, even if it's only temporary. Rearrange furniture, switch teams, switch jobs, move to a different part of the country, change your identity. Do *something* different, see what feels good, and try to understand why. 


# Closing Thoughts
 Burnout can be horrific for everyone involved. For the rest of my leave, my plan is to take it easy and try to deeply rest and restore. For anyone burning out, recognize the signs and symptoms and nip it in the bud often and early. Employers, recognize the needs that may be unmet for your employees, and use your power and privilege to rectify that if you care about their well-being. For anyone who has already burned out, I encourage you to do everything you can to take time away to understand which of your needs are being unmet and do what you can to recover.
